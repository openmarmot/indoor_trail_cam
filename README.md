using  the IMP LLM to take pictures of my cat

## about
I wanted to explore using the excellent IMP AI Image recognition model with a laptop web cam.
This turned out to be fairly easy, and the IMP model is surprising good at this task - even for 
relatively poor images from my laptop webcam.

This repo is more of a proof of concept than anything serious, but this could extended to be a 
pretty amazing trailcam or security camera system.
