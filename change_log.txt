Indoor Trail Cam  : Change Log

----------------------------------
Dec 06 2024
- made image time stamp more readable 
- switched the transformers model to v4.39.2. Newer versions are no longer compatible with this model.
- updated readme screenshot to show a actual image that the software detected a cat in and then saved to a file

I attempted to upgrade to the newer IMP V1.5 model series but I was unable to get the sample code 
for it to run.
