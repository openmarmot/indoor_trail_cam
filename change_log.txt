Indoor Trail Cam  : Change Log

----------------------------------
Jan 02 2025
- added trailcam-pi.py for raspberry pi devices
- venv now brings in host packages - required for pi camera to work 

I spent several hours working on porting this over to work on a raspberry pi 5 but 
was ultimately unsuccessful. I think the code should work - or is close to working 
but I exceeded the pi-5 memory (8gb). Running tests on my laptop suggegsts the model 
may need more like 12-14 GB.

I decided to add this to the repo anyways in case someone wants to pick up where I left 
off and try a smaller model.

- made image time stamp more readable 
- switched the transformers model to v4.39.2. Newer versions are no longer compatible with this model.
- updated readme screenshot to show a actual image that the software detected a cat in and then saved to a file

I attempted to upgrade to the newer IMP V1.5 model series but I was unable to get the sample code 
for it to run.
